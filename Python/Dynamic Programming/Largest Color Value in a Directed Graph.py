 Problem : Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Given a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges:  
- nodes are numbered 0 to n-1.  
- colors[i] is a lowercase letter representing the color of node i.  
- edges[j] = [aj, bj] represents a directed edge from aj to bj.  

A valid path is a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair has a directed edge.  
The color value of a path = number of nodes with the most frequent color in the path.  

Return the largest color value of any valid path, or -1 if the graph contains a cycle.

---

### Example 1:
Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: Path 0 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 contains 3 nodes colored "a".

### Example 2:
Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]  
Output: -1  
Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.

---

### Constraints:
- n == colors.length
- m == edges.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= m <= 10^5
- colors consists of lowercase English letters
- 0 <= aj, bj < n
"""

# ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
# - Use topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) to detect cycles and process nodes in order.  
# - For each node, maintain color_count[node][c] = max count of color c along any path to this node.  
# - Propagate counts along edges and update max color value.  
# - If cycle exists (some nodes never visited), return -1.

                    indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                    if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                        next_queue.append(neighbor)
            queue = next_queue

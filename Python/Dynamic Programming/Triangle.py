 Problem: Triangle

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.  

- For each step, you may move to an adjacent number in the row below.  
- If you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

---

### Example 1:
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]  
Output: 11  
Explanation: Path 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 1 = 11

### Example 2:
Input: triangle = [[-10]]  
Output: -10

---

### Constraints:
- 1 <= triangle.length <= 200
- triangle[0].length == 1
- triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1
- -10^4 <= triangle[i][j] <= 10^4

Follow up: Solve using only O(n) extra space, where n = number of rows.

# ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
# - Use bottom-up Dynamic Programming (DP).
# - Start from second-last row and add the minimum of two adjacent numbers from the row below.
# - Continue until top row contains the minimum total path sum.

 Problem: Minimum Path Sum

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Given an m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top-left to bottom-right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.  
You can only move either down or right at any point.

---

### Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]  
Output: 7  
Explanation: Path 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 1 â†’ 1 minimizes the sum.

### Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]  
Output: 12

---

### Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200
"""

# ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
# - Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to store minimum path sum to each cell.
# - DP[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1])
# - Fill the first row and first column separately since they have only one direction.
# - Return DP[m-1][n-1].
